## About The Project

This project was made for Buildspace GTFOL mini hackaton.

The project was to make an idea board with the following:

* Everyone can have acess, but
* Only members holding a NFT can post.
* Only members holding a NFT can upvote/downvote

For this project we decided to make a slam poetry boad based in this concept:

## Usage

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
